# Coral version contains three parts:
# 1) Version number. Increases least frequently, when there is truly huge
#    concept or/and code change.
# 2) Major number. increases when there is new features. Coral versions
#    with different major numbers offen differ in features, configuration
#    formats, commands, arguments or/and behaviors.
# 3) Minor number. Increases whenever there is a new release. For versions
#    with the same version number and major number, the one with the highest
#    minor is usually the most stable.
