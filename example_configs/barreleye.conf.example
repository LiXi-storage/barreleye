# The interval seconds to collect datapoints.

# This option determines the interval of continuous queries. Barreleye uses
# continuous queries of Influxdb to aggregate data. To calculate the interval
# seconds of continuous queries, please multiply this number by the value of
# the "collect_interval" option. If this number is "1", the interval of
# continous queries would be "collect_interval" seconds. Usually, in order to
# downsample the data and reduce performance impact, this value should be
# larger than "1".
# Default value: 4

# The jobstat pattern configured in Lustre. This includes configuration of
# jobid_var, jobid_name on the Lustre clients. Commands like
# "lctl get_param jobid_var" and  "lctl get_param jobid_name" can be used to
# check the configurations. Some patterns might also depend on other Lustre
# configurations. Barreleye will parse the jobstats and enable some dashboards
# or metrics based on the given pattern.
#
# A value of "unknown" should be specified if the pattern isn't clearly known,
# or if the clients have mixed patterns.
#
# "procname_uid" can be specified if clients all have "jobid_var" configured
# with value "procname_uid".

# Default value: "unknown".
